# cli_pkg's pkg-homebrew-update rewrites exactly one "url" and one "sha256"
# field, pointing them at the GitHub source archive for the released tag. A
# formula with per-platform bottle blocks would have only its first block
# rewritten and the rest left stale, so this must be a source build.
#
# The Dart SDK is vendored as a resource rather than declared as a build
# dependency: Homebrew core has no dart formula, and depending on a
# third-party tap would make every install pull that tap in.
