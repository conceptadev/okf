# ADR-0005: okf owns frontmatter finding IDs; ack hides behind the interpreter seam

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-08-14
- Issues: [#6](https://github.com/conceptadev/okf/issues/6)

## Context

The original #6 mapped ack's constraint keys onto public finding IDs and pinned
that mapping — and the ack dependency version — by test. The version pin was
the tell: a third-party package's internal vocabulary had become load-bearing
in the system's most stable contract (finding IDs are versioned in the registry,
echoed in MCP refusals, and gated on in CI). The pinned mapping test also
reached past the interpreter's stated interface.

## Decision

The interpreter is a deep module: manifest schema subset plus frontmatter in,
findings out. okf owns the finding IDs through a keyword table — each supported
schema keyword maps to a stable `profile/frontmatter-<keyword>` ID (grammar in
ADR-0001). ack stays entirely inside the implementation: its constraint keys
and JSON Pointer paths translate to IDs and Report locations behind the seam,
and nothing outside the interpreter references them. The ack version stays
pinned as dependency hygiene, not as an ID-stability mechanism.

ack itself stays — settled 2026-08-14. This decision changes who owns the IDs,
not which validator runs.

## Consequences

- An ack upgrade cannot change a finding ID; interface-level fixtures prove it.
- The interpreter is tested through its interface only.
- ack becomes swappable in principle (a future JSON Schema engine would be a
  second adapter behind the same seam).
